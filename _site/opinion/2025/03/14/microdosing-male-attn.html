        <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The truth of the matter is, I didn’t want to be this cynical and Machiavellian about love. Relationships are not supposed to be zero-sum games. But when the game is rigged against people like us, and when men take advantage of the trust and care we give them, this approach allows you to enjoy male attention while keeping yourself safe.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer No. 2:</b> The second truth is, as my friend Angie says, I hate men who are mfs. And most men are mfs. None of us need male attention to survive... but, boy, is it fun. It’s like weed. You use it to feel alive, to get that high, but don’t become so addicted that you start thinking, "I need him." Use it sparingly; don’t let the drug use you. You control it—always remember that.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered the disclaimers, here’s how to safely microdose male attention:</p>

<h1>1. Don’t Love the Players, Love the Game</h1>

<p>Focus on your strategy and personal goals, not on any one person. Ask yourself: What do I want from this? A relationship? Instant gratification? Or just attention I didn't get as a kid? In business, the goal is to stay objective and focus on the long-term strategy—not getting emotionally entangled in the success or failure of any one deal.</p>

<p>The worst thing that can happen is losing yourself in someone. When you love the player (not the game), the ship starts sinking, and you lose yourself. But when you focus on the game, you know when to leave, when to “jump ship”—and that gives you clarity.</p>

<p>Loving the game means each player serves a purpose, and you can walk away when they no longer serve you. It’s about maintaining control and realizing that control doesn’t mean manipulation—it means having the option to walk away whenever you want.</p>

<p>So, if a deal goes sour, reflect on what you could have done differently. That makes the experience about learning, not about loss. Like I said, love should never be a zero-sum game—attachment makes it one.</p>

<h1>2. Diversification in Investments: Always Have a Roster</h1>

<p>Having a roster is the best way to prevent attachment. I made the mistake of letting my roster go once I found someone I thought was worth investing in—but I was wrong. It’s like sales: nothing is finalized until the deal is closed. Until you cuff or get cuffed, you have the right to have a roster. Having multiple options prevents you from pouring all your emotional energy into one person (your "stock") and getting too attached.</p>

<p>If you’re focused on just one player, all your emotional eggs are in that basket. Sometimes, you’re reluctant to cut your losses because you feel like walking away will cost you everything. This makes relationships a zero-sum game because you’ve invested more than you should.</p>

<p>The goal of having a roster is not to manipulate your players or toy with their feelings. It is simply to retain sobriety and remind yourself that you are in control. </p>

<h1>3. Microdose Your Attention</h1>

<p>This is where the sales strategy comes in: drip-feeding value to keep the other party interested, without giving everything upfront. Think of it as supply and demand. When you offer something valuable but in small doses, it creates a sense of demand—keeping them coming back for more.</p>

<p>If you over-deliver too soon, they take you for granted. But when you limit access, they begin to see you as high-value and realize you won’t tolerate disrespect or stick around for scraps.</p>

<p>Going back to the roster—since you aren’t giving anyone everything at once, they won’t get tired of you. They won’t have the opportunity to take you for granted.</p>

<h1>TL;DR:</h1>

<p>Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. It's a simple investment strategy: diversify your “portfolio.” When one stock disappoints, you move on without losing everything. Unless you’re 120% sure about a particular stock’s value or loyalty, never go all in.</p>

<h1>Will This Fulfill You?</h1>

<p>Well, it depends. If you’re looking for high returns, maybe not. But if you want low risks, this approach should work well. It leaves room for the possibility of reward—romantic or otherwise. It's basic investment economics: high-risk, high-return; low-risk, low-return.</p>

<p>If you’re seeking deep emotional connections and long-term investing, this “microdosing” approach may feel unsatisfying or superficial. But here’s my take: After experiencing deep emotional connections and still being severely let down, I don’t think it’s worth it. Men (mfs) have mastered enjoying attention without expecting commitment. We should do the same.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t seek star-crossed love from men with the emotional depth of a kiddie pool. Instead, seek multitudes within yourself. This strategy helps maintain balance and manage the expectation that not every connection needs to be deep and life-changing. I don’t need another man roaming this Earth with the knowledge of my deepest, darkest secrets.</p>

<p>The question of whether this microdosing strategy will fulfill you ultimately comes down to personal preference. Understanding this business-savvy approach to male attention reflects boundaries, emotional self-preservation, and risk management. After all, men are not FDIC insured.</p>
