        <p>Last time when I ended my introduction with “I hope to see you here tomorrow”, I forgot that I should be taking breaks every Thursday and Saturday. So yeah, I left y’all hanging sorry. But I am here now and that is what matters. Happy Easter to whom it may concern, I am a vegetarian for one day and I only had 2.5 meals today (veggies for dinner, now come on Jesus would be okay with me eating veggies right). So I thought <i>hey maybe I should talk about Jesus and religion for my article today</i>, but this topic is so intense and interesting maybe I need some more time to plan. But I will definitely talk about my thoughts on religion, Catholicism and Jesus <i>(Spoiler alert I am not a Jesus freak I am not that religious)</i>.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to be spontaneous. Yesterday, while I was eating my fried rice, a peculiar thought crossed my mind: can chickens eat eggs? Is it cannibalism? Upon one google search, I have discovered that it is legal and healthy for chickens to eat eggs. Free ranch chickens eat their own eggs too. That is, of course, when the egg is not fertilised.</p>

<p>But that was just question a) i), you ain’t seen nothing yet. I recall a few years back reading about Kim Kardashian eating her own placenta. a) ii) Should women eat their own placenta? Do they feel weird about it? Also, b) is egg/placenta eating cannibalism? If people are okay with hens eating their eggs, why can’t women eat their placentas?</p>

<p>Personally, I would love to eat my own placenta. Let me explain. I don’t want any kids because kids are annoying and stretch marks are weird (actually I should write about why I don’t want any kids and why kids are annoying omg yes stay tuned), but if the opportunity arises I would like to eat a placenta. There are also placenta pills and placenta facials, but I prefer eating one. I don’t want to eat another person’s placenta though, that is kind of cannibalism. N E ways, I support chickens eating their eggs and women eating placentas.</p>

<p>In the course of my research on canni- I mean placenta-eating, I have learned that rabbits, rodents and wild chimpanzees eat their placentas immediately after birth. Now that is what I call an alpha female move. <i>I have had enough with this baby, now please let me live and feast on my own placenta.</i> Fun fact, mother rats might not kill their own offsprings, but they would kill other children of other females. Virgin females will “often” kill babies. I don’t support infanticide but hey rat girls have their own reasons.</p>

<p>The act of eating your own placenta is called ”Placentophagy”. Keeping this dumb topic short, I’ll leave you this 12 mark question:<br>a) i) Is it okay for chickens to eat their eggs?
<br>   ii) Is it okay for women to eat their placentas? If so, do you want to eat your own placenta?
<br>b) Is placentophagy cannibalism?</p>

<p>I am sorry for wasting your time. But maybe think about this for 10 seconds. I cannot pump out high-quality articles every day, if I do that my higher-quality once will not stand out. Whatever bye.</p>
