        <p>Hello, dears. I am back. Sorry to keep you all waiting. I took my accidental hiatus because I was working on an essay competition. News just in: I won the competition. I am one of the winners. So here I am back again writing my old-fashioned blog go.</p>

<p>I was afraid that I will ditch this project entirely and stop blogging. I was disappointed in myself for ‘taking a break’ after 3 weeks of starting this blog. But my reason is not that bad: I am focusing on another writing project. So as long as I am not ditching writing, I guess it is not the end of the world.</p>

<p>I did a line-by-line analysis of my  essay. I also wrote 7 pages of notes… for my essay. It is not an ego problem, I realised that I don’t really ‘know’ my piece of essay that well. But then I realised how meta it was: like I literally analysed my thing for +4 days. No I am not Shakespeare and no it's not that deep. But it was eye-opening for real.</p>

<p>And then I did my interview yesterday. I thought it was gonna be really scary, like asking me deep questions like, “what is the aim of your essay” or “what would you change in the essay?” And I would be stunned and crickets. But turns out no, they asked me questions WITHIN the essay and “what do I worry besides the government”. These questions are like…  normal boomer questions. Do I hate the government? Lol. I said I worry that I don’t have enough money to buy a house, that all my friends and family secretly hates me, that I’m not doing enough during quarantine, that everyone is dying due to corona but I am privileged enough to sit here and whine about my summer holiday, and “I get really angry I take nap.” This is definitely not a textbook-correct answer. Like, do NOT do this if it is a formal job interview. But this interview was supposed to be formal, so I was doubtful if my answers are too casual. But hey, they laughed and everything went well I guess. At least I won. And this is the story of why I stopped blogging for a while.</p>

<p>Guess what? My next competition is on May 16. But this time I just need to shoot a video, so this is alright. It is less scary. I’m still scared though, cuz originally I was “waitlisted”. Cool. I hope I can do well again. No promises here, I hope I could still update regularly but if I have a lot of schoolwork going on I shall go on a hiatus again. But trust me, feels great to be back. I still have a ton of ideas for blogs. I just don’t have the time to execute it right now. (I am running out of time I love quarantine I kinda don’t want it to end.)</p>

<p>Right, that’s it, time to stop. Still got math and physics and other stuff to do smh. I never proofread my stuff here. Proofreading is for dummies. I am listening to ABBA. Only listen to ABBA if there is something to celebrate.</p>

<p>Maybe I will publish my essay here later. Bye.</p>
