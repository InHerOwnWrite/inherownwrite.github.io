        <p><i>August 01, 1922</i></p>

<p>Old Sport,</p>

<p>Today is simply the most splendid day ever—after five long years, I have finally reunited with Daisy. It was perfect - with Nick’s help, I was able to see the love of my life again. My pain and sorrow for not being with her are now through.</p>

<p>I tried my best to act like I did not practise today’s scene in my mind every night. At one point I had lost hope in her and was almost leaving, but then she arrived, and I chickened out midway because I was so thrilled and scared to meet her once again: what if she doesn’t love me anymore? Is that why she never reached for me? All those parties and gestures I had for her and she barely noticed a thing.</p>

<p>The truth is, five long years flashed before me in my head but the only desire I saw was her. I was a penniless soldier and she was the most popular girl at Camp Taylor. Even back then, we swore on our love to each other and promised to be faithful even when we were apart. When I look back, I never regretted one bit. Daisy Fay moulded my past, present and future. Now that she is back in my arms, I can finally reclaim her love. You could never imagine how long have I been waiting for this day to come.</p>

<p>When I saw her standing in front of me, I almost lost my breath: her impeccable face and looks just warmed my heart and brought back every thought I have been holding onto for the past years. Her hair is now shorter, in a fashionable bob; her innocent, bright eyes were shining right back to mine, I was astonished, and I did not know how to act. There was nothing but silence the first minute we met. It felt like an eternity. I had a thousand words on the tip of my tongue yet not a word is spoken. There was an uneasy feeling at first until Daisy has spoken, “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.” It was truly blissful to hear her golden voice again, it was just music to my ears. This was worse than how I have planned. It was awkward and even humiliating. The welcoming tension between everyone in the room rises, and I couldn’t stand the position I was in. I almost broke Nick’s old clock into pieces. I walked out of pure embarrassment even though I have dreamt of this for so long. Nick then gave me a pep talk and encouraged me to break the ice between us and left his house afterwards. I reminded myself how I longed for this for so many nights so I gave it all out. I did not panic this time around, and I told her how much I have dreamed to see her again. She seems really surprised and glad, and I am certain that we still have a chance to be together. I am sure that she thinks of me sometimes too, but I didn’t ask her. She told me that in my last letter, the one I send her before her wedding, she believed in me. But when I asked her why didn't she waited, she just cried and did not answer. “It’s fine now, we are together and that’s what matters,” I told her, and she falls into my embrace and smiles. Believe me when I tell you, old sport: she makes me feels everything and nothing at the same time. I was elated and wish time would stop forever at that moment.</p>

<p>Nick came back after some time. I took him and Daisy to my place afterwards, to show them around. Little did Daisy knew that all my life I was just waiting for her to see everything I built, just for her. I am not the young officer she once knew anymore, I am an educated, self-made man now who is eligible in winning her heart. But my heart stayed the same for her. I hope she did the same for me.</p>

<p>She was impressed, to say the least. She asked me if I live there all alone, and I told her that I kept my place full of interesting, celebrated people. The truth is, I did feel lonesome without her all the time. All the people and things I had were just distractions, distracting me away from the thought of her. If only she understands. But she just makes everything looks so splendid, and if not for her none of this would ever exist. She is my raison d'être. It doesn’t matter if she is Daisy Fay or Daisy Buchanan, I’m glad as long as she is here with me.</p>

<p>I showed them everything, from the music-rooms to the grand library. To be frank, I could care less about the things in my place, but if Daisy likes it I will give them to her. As we went to my bedroom, I told them about the clothes I got from England. I was thinking that if Daisy loves all of these beautiful things, I might as well manifest all of them. I threw them all to the air and it made her very happy - just shirts mounted on the floor. Then, out of the blue, she started sobbing. I thought I did something wrong that hurt her feelings, but she just said, ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such beautiful shirts before.’ I just held her tight in my arms and soothed her. I am not sure whether it was really because of the shirts, or it is the overwhelming feeling that came over her. I am not thinking too much about the moment; I just hope she is happy with me.</p>

<p>I looked at the green light just outside the window. What used to mean heaven and hell to me, is just another light. This is the day I have longed for so long - I don’t need to stretch out my arms to reach for my desire no more! Aren’t you happy for me, old sport? This sick ambition of mine ever since leaving North Dakota is now gone. I left I am sure that Daisy and I can go back to where we left off and be 18 and 24 again. Nothing is stopping us from being together and I am just really grateful for everything.</p>

<p>We spent the whole day and night together; in fact, she left my house just now. It was euphoria. And when we were dancing in the hall, I could feel her weight pressed against mine; her quiet, relaxed breathing makes me feel calm. It was just like 5 years ago. I hope you could tell by now how this girl makes my life meaningful again, and I just love her so much that she all I ever wanted in my life.</p>

<p>Chicago on the line now, hope Parke could get the bonds right this time. Now that Daisy is back with me, I am actually planning to give up with the business. There is no point in doing all those things anymore, and I just want to be a good man for Daisy.</p>
