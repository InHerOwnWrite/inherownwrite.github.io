        <p> I have finally decided to write something for my blog after a long hiatus. I even skipped the one-year anniversary of In Her Own Write, which is honestly a shame. I wanted to write something special for that occasion, but by the time it arrived I did not have the motivation to do so. Consider this the birthday celebration of IHOW, and also a small update onâ€¦ things in general.</p>

<p>This website was born on April 5, 2020, at the height of my boredom in quarantine. She's an Aries, of course, which is defined by creativity and ambition. While I updated quite a lot at the beginning, I lost a bit of direction towards what I should talk about here when autumn came. More specifically, I think my priorities have shifted quite a lot since that part of quarantine. I would describe it as a "burnout disillusionment", a potential step towards maturity, but quite a sad one. I started posting less on social media, I no longer feel burdened by a glorious purpose or the mounted ambition and responsibility I once had, and overall I am cringing over the me in 2019/2020. Does it really matter if I work really hard, or not at all? It probably doesn't. I have been feeling a sense of guilt over what I have become. Not shame, but guilt. If a person is defined by the choices made in their lives, then consider me a sell-out. The Judas of capitalism girlbosses. The shell that once carried the heart of a pearl. Honestly I have no clue what or why am I writing this this is how unhinged I am. I am no longer romanticizing anything. Does this answer your question?</p>

<p>On a lighter note, I can't wait to begin a new chapter in my life, maybe to find the new purpose in life. Don't worry, I have been disenchanted by the American Dream, the capitalist lie that was dismantled by Twitter leftists. However, it is still nice to think about how I could reinvent myself and have a "semi-fresh" start after staying in the gutter (as in quarantine, not HK) for almost 2 years. There you go. I will try to do more and get back the burning passion I had back when I first started this. It will all turn out fie. That is what I'd like to believe.</p>
