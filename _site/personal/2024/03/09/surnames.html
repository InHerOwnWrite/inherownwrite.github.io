        <p>My father has two surnames.</p>

<h2 id="一-张">一. 张</h2>

<p>The character, 张, or 張 in traditional, means “to open a bow”. The left hand side is 弓, an arrow, and the right hand side is 長, which means “long” or “stretch”.</p>

<p>I went to Jilin with my parents when I was twelve. The countryside was foreign, and the cold, thin air stirred uncomfortable disgust within me. The houses were ancient, and they don’t have hot water for showers or a proper plumbing system. You should have seen the feces-covered pit latrine that they call “toilet”. Being the disdained Hong Konger that I was, I didn’t care much about the unsophisticated country-mouse Zhang relatives that talked in a Northern Chinese dialect. They talk in such a crass and vulgar tone, twisting their mandarin “r”s and making a mockery of my inability to comprehend. I’m not a northern farmer Zhang, I’m a southern city Cheung.</p>

<p>The trip was a glorious pilgrimage for my father, though. It was his trip, his search for vestiges of his father, my Yeye’s childhood, his father’s past life that he never knew. Dad got teary-eyed learning about Yeye’s salad days, how proud he was when he enlisted in the Kuomintang. We found pictures of Yeye in his twenties: he had those dashing looks that were distinctively Northern, with slicked back hair, dark eyebrows, and prominent cheekbones, his beautiful monolids did not prevent his large eyes from sparkling with determination. Think John Lone, but Northerner. That was Lieutenant Zhang who was stationed down south. Lieutenant Zhang who met the Maiden Xie (we call nurses 姑娘, young maidens) at the Guangzhou No. 1 hospital, fell in love, and got married. Lieutenant Zhang who, by 1948, refused to escape to Taiwan and became Comrade Zhang, because Taiwan was too far from home.</p>

<p>My father often retells the story to me. He lingers and wallows in his father’s achievements, as if it was his. After all, he is Yeye’s firstborn son. Despite his enthusiasm, I was more so intrigued by Yeye’s mother, my great-grandmother in Jilin. She was Manchurian, and she had bounded feet in her youth. It was a status symbol in the Qing dynasty, for only noble Manchurian women got to bind them. But that status didn’t matter soon after, she unbounded them after the revolution. Her feet never fully healed from the binding, but my father said she didn’t really mind. She didn’t mind if she stood out like a sore foot in Guangzhou, or that she speaks Mandarin in an era when most spoke Cantonese. She just sits, and sits, and sits in her armchair, with a fan in her hand.</p>

<p>Her maiden surname was Nimaha Hala (尼瑪哈氏). Like other descendants of Manchu people, she was legally forced to change it to 于 so she can assimilate with the Hans. Both mean Fish, but it is so much more majestic in Manchurian. 尼瑪哈氏 is merely the Han Chinese translation. I am sure she would have preferred Nimaha Hala over Yu. I want to find the original language and restore her surname to its full glory, but I couldn’t find it anywhere. Her first name was not recorded on the tombstone.</p>

<p>I am sorry, great granny.</p>

<h2 id="二-張">二. 張</h2>

<p>My dad was forced to farm for three years before going to college during the cultural revolution.</p>

<p>He wanted to be a sailor when he was young. That never happened, but he still wants to buy a boat and name it Little Seagull. To honor that little boy.</p>

<p>I was so relieved to know that my father changed from 张 Zhang to 張 Cheung when he immigrated to Hong Kong as a college-educated businessman. It is the same character, but one is simplified and mandarin, while the other is traditional and Cantonese. I thought Cheung sounds so much cooler and better than Zhang. Leslie Cheung, Jacky Cheung, Maggie Cheung, Ka-long Cheung. Had he not changed it, I would get the last class number from C-Z, and my classmates would know my parents’ parents weren’t from Hong Kong. They would have bullied me for being a 大陸人mainlander, just like how I bullied that mandarin-speaking girl back in primary school (My bad, Gigi).</p>

<p>Unlike my hostility for my mainland extended family, my father wished he had known more about Yeye’s past life. He can’t get rid of the Cantonese accent in his Mandarin.</p>

<p>Men have the privilege of concealing their marital history with their surnames. You can’t tell with Mr. like with Miss. or Mrs. So, to honor that privilege, I won’t talk about my father’s. I will spare my father from the wrath of my tongue and the blade of my pen. I would probably need a whole other chapter to talk about it anyway.<br />
我期待可以佢同我坦白嘅一日。</p>

<p>Women never had surnames. Sir-names. They have one, but it’s not really theirs. Their maiden name belongs to their fathers, their married surnames belonged to their husband’s, and their children’s surnames follow their husbands.<br />
My mother has three surnames. She changed it three times.</p>

<h2 id="i-李">I. 李</h2>

<p>My mother’s father killed himself during the cultural revolution. He was a Chinese professor prosecuted for writing, teaching and spreading capitalist filth to the young proletariat minds. The Red Guards were going to torture him until he confesses his crimes, crimes he did not commit.</p>

<p>Suicide is usually not an honorable or commendable thing to do. They say suicide does not take away the pain, it simply transfers to a different person. But in his case, my entire family agreed that he died with glory. His suicide was similar to the Japanese Seppuku: he would rather end his own life to restore honor to his family, than to fall into the enemies’ hands and get martyred. It is the most honorable and commendable thing he could do.</p>

<p>My mother never got to truly know her father, but she knew her surname. 李. A plum. A tree on top, a child at the bottom. I think of a girl standing under a tree in the rain. It is the surname of the great Tang emperors, as well as numerous famous ancient poets, one of which 李商隱, the Sylvia Plath of her time. She really liked that about Li.</p>

<p>When she came to America with her mother, she decided to give herself the English name Edith. She named herself after Edith Piaf, the French singer that sang Non, je ne regrette rien.</p>

<h2 id="ii-hopkins">II. Hopkins</h2>

<p>I came across this surname accidentally. It was not my intention to pry into my mother’s past, a past she perhaps intended to conceal. I only knew that she wished she had majored in Comparative Literature or East Asian studies instead of Business in college. Given what happened to her father, I suppose I understand. But it was very ironic when she supported my decision to do Electrical Engineering instead of Creative Writing or English. Non, je ne regrette rien my ass.</p>

<p>I was tidying up my grandmother’s belongings when I saw the following:<br />
<strong>SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br />
<strong>XXX-XX-2942</strong><br />
<strong>THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR</strong><br />
<strong>EDITH JING-TIAN HOPKINS</strong></p>

<p>What the hell is this white-sounding surname?</p>

<p>The more I know, the more I realize I don’t know.</p>

<p>With the social security card, I also found a void house title. It was an apartment in Brooklyn, New York, co-shared with a man also with surname.</p>

<p>Before you ask, don’t you worry. This isn’t soap opera. I looked like a carbon copy of my father when I was a kid. (Thank God I don’t anymore.) The resemblance, one may argue, is uncanny. Some aunties still say that I have a bit of my handsome Jilin grandfather on my face.</p>

<p>I imagine my mother in her twenties, slamming the door in Popo’s face after a heated argument, running off to marry a starving artist gwailo husband Popo didn’t approve of, like in Everything Everywhere All At Once.</p>

<p>I think about this often, but I didn’t think too much of it. I will write more about this when my mother is comfortable to share it with me. Trust me, I want to know more as much as you do. Perhaps even more. But this is not investigative journalism. I won’t interrogate my mother about it.</p>

<h2 id="iii-張">III. 張</h2>

<p>My dad was my mom’s manager. Is that an HR violation? She consented to it and left the company when they got married, so I suppose it’s not quid pro quo.</p>

<p>She changed her Chinese name at one point to bring in more luck and money to the marriage. The effort was soon proved to be futile.</p>

<p>My mom had me when she was 39. She didn’t want to be tied down by a baby in her 20s and 30s.</p>

<p>My mom wanted a girl. My dad wanted a boy.</p>

<p>In China, you don’t get to see your child’s sex because too many girls were aborted from the One Child Policy. But they were in Hong Kong, so they get to know my gender before I was born.</p>

<p>Us girls are ordained disappointments. There’s a saying in Chinese, 望子成龍, hoping your son becomes a dragon. But there isn’t one about hoping your daughter becomes a phoenix.</p>

<p>My dad got over the disappointment. I know that he would have preferred if I had a penis, a sentiment I do not share. He never really treated me as less than or anything, but he never really expected me to become anything, or anyone.</p>

<p>My mother named me 宇昕 (“cosmic dawn”) because it is unisex and sanguine. She wanted me to be optimistic and ambitious, even when the odds are stacked against me. She picked “Veronica” because she loved Winona Ryder’s character Veronica Sawyer in <em>Heathers</em>.</p>

<p>My looks, my principles, my accomplishments. She never doubted me even when I doubted myself. But take away all of that, she loved me for me. It was from her that I learned about my inherent value. Happiness was enough. I was enough.</p>

<p>She raised me the way she wished she was raised by, to be stronger and braver than the typical feminine Chinese values of humility and obedience. She believed that I could be more, so I did.</p>

<h2 id="iv-李">IV. 李</h2>

<p>My mother became the child underneath the plum tree again. But instead of “Li”, like the pinyin, she became “Lee”. Bruce Lee, Brenda Lee, Stan Lee, Spike Lee. Lee Harvey Oswald. It is ambiguous. It is multi-faceted.</p>

<p>Popo says that my mother has never settled down once in her life. In my opinion, settling is compromising with your available choices. Knowing my mother, I don’t think she would settle with settling down.</p>

<p>I dwell in my past a lot, but my mother doesn’t. She seldom talks about who she was or who she knew; she refuses to let that define her. She has the novelty that I seek. Still, I suppose that there will always be a part of her that is locked in a vault of secrecy, like my father with his father.</p>

<p>Edith Li, Edith Hopkins, Edith Cheung, Edith Lee. She is ambiguous. She is multi-faceted.</p>

<p>All these stories were frankensteined from numerous anecdotes and recollections I heard over during Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn festival, and Tomb-sweeping Day. I cannot affirm that the story I told shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, but they do contain ounces of truth to them.</p>

<p>The last stop in Jilin was 張氏祠堂 (the Ancestry Temple of the Zhangs). It was surrounded by my ancestors’ gravestones, but the temple itself was quite shabby and small. It was nothing like those fancy gilded Buddhist temples, nor does it resemble the one in <em>Mulan</em>. Inside temple lay 張氏族譜 (The Book of Zhang Lineage), sitting quietly at the center.</p>

<p>Correction: the book is not exactly The Book of Zhang Lineage. It is more like, The Book of Zhang Sons Lineage That We Vaguely Remember.</p>

<p>It resembles a tree diagram I learned in Computer Science data structures. Each person is a node. A node has a label and branches. The label is the name. The branches carry its descendants. Sons are child nodes. Daughters are not child nodes. They don’t count. Daughters get married off and give birth to child nodes of other trees.</p>

<p>It was there that I learned the differences between a Zhang boy and a Zhang girl. Or a Cheung girl, for that matter. I didn’t like the Book, even as a twelve-year-old: I couldn’t understand why I don’t get to be in it, while my cousins and half-brother do. Nobody explained it to me explicitly, but I knew that no matter how hard I try to become an honorary son to my father, no matter how accomplished or filial I am, I would never become a node on that book. These surnames carry the legacy of my father, his father, and his father, but it barely encapsulates the thickness of my blood. Just like my mother, and her mother, and her mother before her… left out of their maiden surname’s ancestry books, lost in the currents of history.</p>

<p>Fuck that Book. I will write my own Book.</p>

<p>It will carry more information than just surnames.</p>

<p>I will be my own cosmic dawn.</p>
