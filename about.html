<p><i>Veronica Cheung is a 16-year-old Scorpio. She is too shy to go on camera, too lazy to edit videos, and hates her voice a bit too much to make a podcast. All grammar mistakes in this page is excused because she is not good at grammar. She founded In Her Own Write on April 3, but the website was published on April 5.</i></p>

<p>On April 3, 2020, I suddenly had an urge to make a blog and talk about 'stuff'. With the help of my little coding superpowers. Here is my bloggish thing! I still haven't decided on the name of my 'blog' yet, but we'll see.</p>

<p>The main reason for me starting this is to show some other sides of me, Veronica. You can see a more detailed explanation in my first post, but basically, I don't want one part of me to define me. We all want to show parts of ourselves we want to show other people, but not the insecurities and worries. Here, I will try to comfortably open up and talk about stuff. Not like super personal stuff though, just other parts of my brain that deserves everyone's attention. I hope this won't be awkward cuz really, this is my place to talk and I get to do my own show. </p>

<p class="mb-5">I've always imagined myself as a stand-up comedian, talking about my anecdotes and unnecessary opinions (that no one asked). My time to shine. Hope I won't get cancelled for this.</p>
