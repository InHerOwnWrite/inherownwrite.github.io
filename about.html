<p><i>Veronica Cheung is a 17-year-old Scorpio. All grammar mistakes made on this website is excused because she is not good at grammar. Dear viewers are highly recommended to read <a href="/jekyll/update/2020/04/08/in-her-own-write.html">the Origin Story</a> here.</i></p>

<p> Bored in quarantine, I suddenly had the urge to make a blog and talk about 'stuff'. With the help of my little coding superpowers, In Her Own Write was founded on April 3 2020, but the website was officially published on April 5. </p>

<p>The main reason for me starting this is to show some other sides of me, Veronica. Or Roni. Basically, I don't want one part of me to define me. We all want to show parts of ourselves we want to show other people, but not the insecurities and worries. Here, I will try to comfortably open up and talk about stuff. Not like super personal stuff though, just other parts of my brain that deserves everyone's attention. I hope this won't be awkward cuz really, this is my place to talk and I get to do my own show. </p>

<p class="mb-5">I've always imagined myself as a stand-up comedian, talking about my anecdotes and unnecessary opinions (that no one asked). My time to shine. Hope I won't get cancelled for this.</p>
