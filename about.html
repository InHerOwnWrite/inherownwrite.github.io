<p><i>In Her Own Write is a Scorpio ENFP 4w3. Viewers are highly recommended to read <a href="/jekyll/update/2020/04/08/in-her-own-write.html">the Origin Story</a> here.</i></p>

<p> Bored in quarantine, I had the insatiable urge to make a blog and talk about 'stuff'. With the help of my little coding superpowers, In Her Own Write was founded on April 3 2020, but the website was officially published on April 5. There was also a podcast of the same name in 2021, but I kind of forgot about it lol. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2PbXiyWCXw7sGarD8rl9sB?si=df71a4acf815471f">Here</a> is the link to the show; it is in Cantonese and it is quite embarrassing, so I highly encourage NOT to check it out. Maybe I will restart the show when I'm employed and have more time.</p> 

<p>Fast forward to 2025, I am now graduating from UC Berkeley with an Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences degree. I am slowly morphing into the very thing I swore to destroy (a Silicon Valley techbro); so to reignite my passion for life, I want to pick up the habit of writing again and utilize this platform 2020 me built for myself. No Substack, just ambition and code.</p>

<p>The main reason for me starting this is to show some other sides of me as a person. I have always suspected people don't take me too seriously as a person due to my silly, unserious demeanor in person. For a more detailed breakdown (pun-intended), please read <a href="/jekyll/update/2022/08/29/the-jesters-murder.html">this post here</a>. We all want to show the best sides of ourselves, and this is the serious, emotional side of me. I will try to comfortably open up and talk about stuff. Not like super personal stuff though, just other parts of my brain that deserves everyone's attention. I hope this won't be awkward cuz really, this is my place to talk and I get to do my own show. </p>

<p class="mb-5">I've always imagined myself as a stand-up comedian, talking about my anecdotes and unnecessary opinions (that no one asked). My time to shine. Hope I won't get cancelled for this. Some sections are password-protected for that very reason.</p>
