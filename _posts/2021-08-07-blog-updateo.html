<p> Hello. Greetings. Yes. Feels great to be back. I have ghosted for a couple months now but please believe me when I say I haven't forgot about this. </p>

<p> When I first started this side project, this was my main project. I was at the peak of quarantine boredom. It was almost like I was using writing to regain a sense of purpose, a sense of control in my life. I would always be proud of this site- I conceived it, I gave birthed to it, I wrote it, I published it. This is practically my first-born child. It was also the first creative outlet I have ever created for myself, which paved the way to the creation my other platforms (for those who know). However, when it comes to my most "presentable" outlet, it would definitely be my blog. It is cheaply built, cheaply made (just a few lines of HTML code), but I guess it is the simplicity that counts. Nothing gimmicky, nothing too out-of-the-box, just a gal, her typewrite-keyboard, and a string of big bombastic words. </p>

<p> The heartfelt sentiment above is not a goodbye statement, fret not. This is just an update on how my schedule has changed, but my priority has not. In fact, when I write articles for my writing class later, I think it would be fun for me to post them here. No promises though. </p>

<p> One cool thing I'd like to tease is my upcoming DSE English Writing Paper story. As you know, I am best at writing when I am under pressure, and all of my exams' short stories had been spectacular, to say the least. So, I am beyond pumped to get my papers back and take a look at my 5** piece. It is based on the Short Story question, of course, and the title of the story is ñThe MummyÍs Mummyî. Long story short, it is a allegorical social commentary on feminism and girlbossery, with a dose of slasher thriller. All I am saying is, please be excited. </p>

<p> I have yet to find the origin story of <i>Lady Inor, Countess of Peanut Butter</i> (a thing I wrote like 6 months ago), but I will try my best. DonÍt expect too much though. I might even post some Chinese stuff to maintain my language skills. </p>

<p> That would be it for my channel update. Thank you, my loyal reader. </p>

<p> With shades of love and ever-lusting jealousy, </p>
<p> Veronica</p>
<p><i> P.S. I don't know if you noticed but I think I have changed my writing style 3 times throughout this article</i></p>
