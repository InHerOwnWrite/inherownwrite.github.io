<p>Growing up, I have always considered myself a streetsmart person over a booksmart person. I was so egotistic, that I even looked down upon people that I deemed as “nerds”, aka boring people who get good grades and have virtually no personality. Booksmart is about grades (in the books), while streetsmart is about the way of life (on the streets). I did not think about the consequences of getting Cs, the most important thing in life is to crack people up with my “quick-wittedness”, y’know how teenagers roll. Peer validation was the only form of validation that matters. And so, streetsmart became the sort of branding I gave myself: I may not get the highest grades in class, but I will vouch for the happiness people’s laughter/ approval could bring me. That was my goal, I was better than the nerds because I am wittier and better at socializing.</p>

<p>That is, until recently, my perspective has changed gradually but fundamentally. I don’t know if this is maturity or career-planning-ground-control-to-major-roni, but I have come to the partial conclusion that booksmart would actually get you further in life than streetsmarts. Or, alternatively, both must be incorporated into a person in order for them to be successful.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the difference between cleverness, smartness, intelligence, and wisdom? After a little contemplation and introspective reflection, I have deduced the formulas for these measures of mental ability: <br>Smartness: 10% of Streetsmart + 20% Booksmart = 30%<br>Cleverness: 20% Streetsmart + 30% Booksmart = 50%<br>Intelligence: 20% Streetsmart + 60% Booksmart = 80%<br>Wisdom: 30% Streetsmart + 120% Booksmart = 150%</p>

<p>Streetsmart comes from intuitive experiences, while booksmart accumulates from knowledge and philosophy. When I was a kid, I thought of myself as streetsmart because of my quick-wittedness and the fables I heard from people about “big life lessons”. I thought I knew everything without doing anything. I guess I was smart, but I was not intelligent. And in fact, being arrogant and boastful blocked people like me from ever reaching that other 50% of booksmart potential, which subsequently hinders the amount of knowledge I was able to accumulate.</p>

<p>Streetsmart can only get you so far in life. It is a boost for your abilities indeed, and I can’t really show you ways to “gain” streetsmart. You would know how to manipulate, strategize, and use logic to destroy your mortal enemies. These are only the essential skills of a businessman or a  mafia boss, but not of a successful or happy person in general. After all these years of glorifying streetsmarts, I now personally look down upon people that wield that as their sole skill. Streetsmarts cap at about 20% of your “smartness”, but it would not make up for the rest of the hard work you need to put in. Not to mention, none of us have the “maximum” amount of streetsmarts. There will always be people that are effortlessly smarter than you, and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>Actually, there is something you can do: become booksmart. You may lose the battle of streetsmarts, but know that the war of booksmarts has barely begun. The beauty of being booksmart lies in the fairness of its game: you just got to work hard. Call me delusion or whatever, but now that I am in the land of the free and the home of the brave, I irrevocably believe that working hard will get you far in life. Soaking yourself in the aroma of knowledge… in pursuit of the truth through the bounds of humanity fulfills our experiment of life. Finding a passion in your major or your hobby is such a unique experience, and the process of paving the way for yourself is such a fun gamble. C’est la vie, damn it.</p>

<p>Being knowledgeable and accumulating a taste brings you respect from other people. Moreover, it is ultimately booksmart that makes money. Do you think being cunning can make you billions? It helps, of course, but you have to at least get into college before you start a company in Silicon Valley. And the best but worst part is, most of being booksmart is fair and accessible, all you got to do is study. Yes, I know that some people don’t have access to books or a proper education, but this does not apply to the common understanding of being “knowledgeable”. In general, being booksmart is a lifestyle. It’s the attitude of being inquisitive, striving for better, constantly improving your skills, and being aware of the area for improvement. And I think this would bring happiness and success to your life.</p>

<p>If you are not streetsmart, get that 20% of booksmarts to become “clever”. If you are streetsmart, get that 50% of booksmarts to harness your “intelligence”. Bottom line is, books do not discriminate. Being booksmart is so underrated nowadays, we have to start celebrating smart sexy people instead of bimbos. Or this is just me rambling at midnight, but you get the idea.</p>
