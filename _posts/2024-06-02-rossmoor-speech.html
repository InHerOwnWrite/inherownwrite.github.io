<p>Dear esteemed guests, members of the Rossmoor Scholarship Foundation, donors, and scholars, </p>
<p>It is with great honor and gratitude that I stand before you as a former recipient of the Rossmoor Scholarships. My name is Veronica, and I cannot believe that it has already been a year since I have received the awards in this very room.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, I would like to congratulate all the Rossmoor Scholars. If you are a recipient, please take a moment to pat yourself on the back for all the hard work that has brought you to this point. The donors and members of Rossmoor took the time to get to know you as an individual, and they care enough to offer financial assistance to invest in you and your future. Receiving this award meant so much to me, especially as a community college graduate, as it was one of the first few moments where I don’t feel subpar to a 4-year college student. Standing here today, I felt seen not just as a student, but as a person who has proven their ability to succeed. I want you to feel the same way; you were hand-picked by someone who believes in you. Congrats. </p>

<p>So, here is a little bit more about me. I wasn’t the quote-unquote nerd or teacher’s pet back in high school. I even looked down on those people, calling them try-hards. Instead, I was the class clown. Just to give you an idea, I printed out Facebook pictures of my English teacher with his ex-girlfriend back in 8th grade because he gave me a talking-to. I loved making people laugh, and I thought I was being edgy and cool. Looking back, it was immature of me to judge others, as I, myself, had become a try-hard and a teacher’s pet at DVC. I decided that I wanted more than chuckles and giggles from my classmates. I reflected on my priorities in life and changed my approach to school.</p>
<p>Flash-forward to the summer of last year. I worked super hard and finished with a 4.0 at DVC. I even secured a job before I started at Berkeley, as an iOS engineer at Quizlet. You guys know the app, right? I assume that most of you are either rising freshmen or juniors in college, and let me tell you, those were two of the best summers I have ever had. Free from the shackles of studying and college applications, I could finally breathe. </p>
<p>But little did I know, the real challenge was waiting for me at Berkeley. Here is a five-word horror story for you: I almost got a C. *gasps* Hey, don’t judge me; I was working part-time and busy being an officer for a club. So cut me some slack here, okay? And no, I wasn’t partying; electrical engineering majors don’t get to do that. Not only were the classes fifty times harder, it was also recruitment season. It’s like applying to colleges, but worse. This time around, companies get to test you on the things school never taught you, they inspect you under a microscope during the interviews, and if they don’t like you, they can just ghost you without explanation.</p>
<p>Now that my first semester of college is behind me, I can confidently tell you what I did wrong: I overcommitted myself to things. I was working so hard to build the perfect resume that I ended up burning myself out. Here’s the main piece of bad news I want to share today: the grind never ends. Just when you think your work is done, another challenge presents itself. The “I’ve made it!” feeling typically lasts for a few weeks tops, then life hits you with another tough midterm or job application rejection.</p>
<p>But here’s the good news: the grind never ends. And by “the grind,” I am referring to the pursuit of passions and goals. When I was working with a Stanford-educated engineering manager, I told her that I hoped to reach that point in life where I could just stop striving and be satisfied. She replied that what I was describing sounded like retirement. Yet, when I look at someone like her, I think, “Wow, that’s who I want to become.” She candidly shared that she also admires her mentors and aspires to be like them. As long as there’s something within you to improve, you must keep aiming higher. It’s not a competition, but a hunger for growth. And that is the essence of ambition.</p>
<p>Now, all of this may sound extremely tiring. I’m not suggesting you wake up at 5 AM and start brainstorming your next Silicon Valley startup; think of it this way: your career isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. This upcoming summer is a perfect time to relax and reflect on your future. But after that, brace yourself for the big decisions and obstacles ahead. Life is tough, but so are you. And in case you are wondering, I am doing a lot better now. I stepped down from the officer position to fully invest in my classes and my work at Quizlet, which I both find to be equally fulfilling. I went from a jokester who didn’t take school seriously, to a try-hard who took everything a little too serious to the point of burned out, and finally, to somebody who is steadily building her blossoming career.</p>
<p>You might look at me, and think, “Wow, Veronica has it all figured out!” Or, “Hm, Veronica seems really insecure about her accomplishments.” Both perspectives are somewhat true. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and could talk about my experiences at Berkeley and Quizlet for hours, yet I remain constantly ambitious and hungry for more. </p>
<p>Here is the last call to action I have for you. Number one, I strongly recommend keeping in touch with the Rossmoor community after today, with a biyearly email or something, so they know you appreciate them as much as they appreciate you. Not to be cheesy, but, a heart full of gratitude is a heart full of joy. Number two, promise yourself to remember the emotions you feel today, all the pride and joy. Remember how nice it felt when you picked out the outfit you’re wearing, and when you come up to take pictures on this stage with the guests. When times are rough, remind yourself of today, how wondrous it is to be recognized and awarded by the lovely folks of Rossmoor. Let that fuel your mind, body, and soul. When the road gets tough, remind yourself how much you deserve this, how hard you’ve worked to get here. And as Shakespeare said it, the world is your oyster. Work hard, and the pearl is yours. Thank you.</p>
