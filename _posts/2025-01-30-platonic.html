<p>guys i think i cooked with this one. lately i have this new theory.</p>

<p>yes, but under one condition: mental castration.</p>

<p>and they are only platonic when both have mutually castrated/ neutered each other. by that i mean, when neither parties don’t acknowledge that they are sexually viable.</p>

<p>when i think of the male-female friendships that i have that lasted, i view those men are court eunuchs. i know that sounds bad, and this does not like reflect their actual sexual value, im not trying to invalidate their masculinity, but it’s true. i mentally castrated them, they are unfuckable. or sometimes some of them are just so ugly that they come castrated.</p>

<p>and if i have a male friend that i dont mentally castrate, they end up either being a) kept at an arms length, or b) friendship ends at some point.</p>

<p>like, i cant be friends with you mentally knowing that you have a third leg.</p>

<p>im pretty sure it works differently for guys. i dont think guys mentally neuter women that often.</p>
