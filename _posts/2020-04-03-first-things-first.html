<p>I hope I can somehow “inspire” you to do stuff.</p>

<p>Basically, one of my goals this break is to not let one part of myself define my entire being. What I mean by that is I don’t want to display just one interest/ hobby/ personality of mine define lolurnotveronica. I like music, I like films, I like my turtles, but I’m much more than that. I think one of the main problems with social media (there are a LOT of problems) is that people tend to define themselves to one certain aspect. like your appearance, your sports team, your school stuff, your food and your travels. I don’t know how to fix that, cuz deep down all we want is to display the best part of ourselves.</p>

<p>But there is no “best part of ourselves”. There are a hundred layers to a person. And it is hard to display all of that in one, instagram story. The worst part is, we don’t want others to know the ugly parts of ourselves. so when people post stuff about themselves, they only post the cool stuff to make ppl like them. That is completely fine, like we would do that already social media or not. The problem is, it creates an illusory persona that might make us feel like we need to live ‘up’ to that standard. For example, photoshopping yourself makes you look cooler. But if you photoshop every single picture of yourself, it makes you think that people would only like you if you look like your photoshop self. Truth is, you will never be satisfied. The person in that picture is no longer ‘you’. That, my friend, is the ‘you’ you want people to look at, to believe that is you.</p>

<p>Why am I bringing this up? Because I want to start this blog/ online journal thing to start sharing other part of lolurnotveronica. A part that, still, would be semi-idealistic and too-cool-for-instagram, but at least I can share something. I wanna talk about things that are not always displayed through Instagram stories, parts of me that I want to share but might come off as ‘pretentious’ and annoying just to spam everyone. This is like a glimpse of my brain and opinions that I’ve always wanted to share.</p>

<p>This is not ‘the best part of myself’. But it certainly is one part of lolurnotveronica. I don’t have perfect grammar or perfect writing styles, but I think you don’t need that to share things effectively. Actually you do but, whatever I have Grammarly.</p>

<p>I might also do some movie reviews, fav book of the week, spotify playlist etc. All kinds of pretentious stuff that I feel uncomfortable doing on Instagram stories. You can't judge the content here, right? This is literally my show.</p>
