<p>Retail therapy does not work.</p>

<p>I wasted so much money I hate it. 無事出街少破財. Stuff I buy are in the grey area between want and need, like a my-life-could-go-on-without-it-but-it-would-make-a-great-difference-if-I-have-it. Now I question myself if I deserved it or not, and the social pressure of being a good child or something. Honestly, I am wasting money and food and all earthly resources. So I don’t know if this would make a difference.</p>

<p>NEVERTHELESS, I have two competitions to look forward to + work on, and this is by no means a flex bc this is some hard work. I still haven’t worked on the late-April one and I have approx. a week to finish up. I am not a competitive person at all. I never won any HK School music/speech festival. I am not a lucky person. I just thought that I could kill some time by joining some essay-writing competitions, and here I am working on two. Plus homework, ah, homework. They have no reason to exist. Out here killing my vibe. Am I worthy? I am not sure. Maybe I am. Maybe I’m not. I am tired. Physically and mentally tired. I am still grateful tho. Grateful for opportunities, life and Oscar Isaac. Peace</p>
