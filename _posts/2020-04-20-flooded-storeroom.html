<p>I actually wrote a lot of stuff today, just not on here. For academic and competition reasons. Hey I have 8 days till my interview and today is the first day that I start working on it! Cool, right? I mean, I am pretty scared but at the same time feeling pretty good about this.</p>

<p>Anyways, the storeroom located in my room flooded last night at 3:00 AM. I was sleeping for approx. 2 hours, then I heard the sound of water dripping not far away from my bed. It sounds like a river washing  down. So I got up and opened the door to my bathroom. Turns out that the toilet was leaking (the side the toilet to be exact, its clean saltwater) and all my books were wet. Called my parents and we rendered this mess all the way until 4AM. Then I didn’t think much about it, went back to sleep and woke up at 11AM. Funny story right. No it is not funny at all. My baby storybooks and exercise books and all of my archive stuff were all gone. It was very saddening the books aren’t even dried yet. Had to use a hairdryer. And all them pages now look like they’ve been deep fried. Cool </p>
