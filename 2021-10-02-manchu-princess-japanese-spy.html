<p><i>Here before you is a good example of a person who was used by others and then thrown away like garbage. Have a good look at me. I offer this warning to you based on my own experience.</i></p>

<p>I have recently finished a biography on Kawashima Yoshiko named "Manchu Princess, Japanese Spy", and I have a lot to say about it. I think it is quite well-written and straight-to-the-point, it did not take me too long to finish the entire book, about 4 hours combined. Before I jump into the subject matter, that is, my serious thoughts on Yoshiko Kawashima, I would like to give some background information.</p>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<p>I was immediately hooked when I saw this book at my local library. The cross-dressing, masculine-presenting Kawashima Yoshiko (川島芳子) or Aisin Gioro Xianyu (愛新覺羅 顯玗) was the Joan of Arc or Mata Hari, depending on which side you're on. She was Manchu royalty by birth but was adopted by a Japanese General at the age of 6. Her father, brother to the second-last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, gifted Xianyu to his Japanese Bestie General Kawashima Naniwa (who could not have any children), and she became his adoptive daughter.</p>

<p>I will be skipping the early years part and jump straight ahead to the years of Japanese invasion. Basically, she had an affair with an evil Japanese general called Tanaka Ryuichi, she was hanging out in clubs at Shanghai and possibly collecting information for the Japanese military, and she thought by aiding the Japanese with building Manchuria/ Manchukuo there would be hope to restore the Qing Dynasty and take power in Manchuria. So she did the Japanese army stuff in China here and there, but she claimed that she did not want to harm Chinese people. She also had pet monkeys. The Japanese lost WWII, she was arrested as a Chinese traitor (despite knowing minimum Chinese and raised in Japan). Some Japanese Novelist wrote a novel based on her life, it was used as evidence for her betraying China. She was sentenced to death in 1948.  </p>

<h3>My Intrusive Thoughts While Reading</h3>
<p>Here is a list of my intrusive thoughts while reading the book: <br><i>She's hot</i><br><i>Her husband's hot</i><br><i>Her servant girl's hot</i><br><i>Her secretary's hot</i><br><i>That's not very girlboss of her.</i><br><i>qing royalty ppl are so stupeed for thinking the japs were trying to help them... like WAKE UP BRO jap people are jus trying to eat china they literally think they are the white people of asia... yall are so naive and stupid fr</i></p>

<h3>My Serious Thoughts on Yoshiko Kawashima</h3>
<p>In my humble opinion, Yoshiko Kawashima was a product of her time. For God's sake, she was a Manchu Princess born in the WORST time possible with terrible parents (biological and adoptive) and she tried her best to survive. Her adoptive father SAed her and she had to go though that alone. She wanted to "live as a man" so she didn't have to face "women's problems". It's tragic, really; the men in her life sucks. All they did was use her and toss her away when she was no longer needed. That includes her fathers, her bfs and the Japanese military. I completely support her when she said "I dont't like men. They only make trouble for women." That is so true. To understand her perspective, you got to know that she had to carry the identity of a "Manchu princess", whatever that means. She wanted to restore the Qing dynasty, and she was indoctrinated into the position she was in. She got so much sh!t for it simply because she's a woman. Because she was tossed away by her father. I am not excusing for the terrible things she had done in aiding Japan, but I don't think one could blame a person that is forced into so many situations.</p>

<p>There are so many ambiguities with Yoshiko Kawashima's identity. She's Japanese, she's Chinese Manchurian. She betrayed China, she was never involved with China. She's a man, she's a woman. I genuinely think that she actually is a masc-presenting bisexual she/they. She uses boku and ole. </p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>In conclusion, I am a Yoshiki- I mean Yoshiko Kawashima apologist and sympathizer. Her unique position as a manchu princess japanese-raised spy made her this way. She was born into the worst era, into the worst family in the worst way possible. It's not her fault. How can you call her a Chinese traitor (漢奸) when she is not even Chinese/漢 in the first place?! She may be a war criminal, but I don't think it is fair to call her a betrayer. She gaslighted, she gatekeeped, she girlbossed.</p>
